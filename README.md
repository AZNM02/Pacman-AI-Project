# Pacman-AI-Project

Search: Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

Multi-Agent Search: Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms and designed evaluation functions.

Reinforcement Learning: Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms.

Ghostbusters: Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
